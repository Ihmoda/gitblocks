                    <h3>What is Git?</h3>
                    <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments into your app.</p>
                    <h3>What is Github?</h3>
                    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

                        <h4>Git Init</h4>
                        <p><span>Git init</span> is the act of registering this current codebase</p>

                    <div class="inline">
                        <h4>Git Add</h4>
                        <p><span>Git Add</span> is how we stage the integration of our current code base into our current list of snapshots</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="inline2">
                        <h4>Git Add</h4>
                        <p><span>Git Status</span> allows us to see the changes we are going to make</p>

                    <div class="inlinemed">
                        <h4>Git commit</h4>
                        <p><span>Git Commit</span>; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made.</p>

                    <div class="inlinemed2">

                        <p><span>Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online repository where we can place all of our current code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>
